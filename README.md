# Viet-Noms-Scraper

This is a recipe scraper I built for my favorite recipe website, Viet World Kitchen. This app will allow users to scrape recipes from vietworldkitchen.com using Cheerio and save their favorites into a Mongo database. Users will also be able to make & save comments or notes for each recipe saved into the database.

## Technologies Used
* Node.js
* Express
* Express-Handlebars
* Mongoose
* MongoDB
* Body-Parser
* Cheerio
* rRequest
* JavaScript
